Based on Kaggle's Freesound General-Purpose Audio Tagging Challenge from 2018:

This is a model composition that infers the source of a sound (trumpet, meow, etc.) given audio input, using the Keras library in Python. [TagAudio.ipynb](https://github.com/QColeman97/AudioTagger/blob/master/TagAudio.ipynb) is the golden notebook.
